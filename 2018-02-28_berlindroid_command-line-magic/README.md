## Abstract
A talk about various command line tools that are useful in general, tools that
are handy for Android developers, and how to combine both to make magic happen.

## Notes
This talk was almost entirely done from within a terminal window with
continuous demos, so the slides may not be 100% useful.

However, there are URLs throughout the presentation to the software used,
and the `fzf` scripts demonstrated are linked below.
